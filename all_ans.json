    "<|im_start|>assistant\nTo determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid by the ducks each day.\n2. Determine how many eggs Janet eats for breakfast.\n3. Subtract the number of eggs eaten from the total number of eggs laid to find out how many eggs are left for selling.\n4. Calculate the revenue from selling the remaining eggs.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. The ducks lay 16 eggs per day.\n2. Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. So, the number of eggs left after breakfast is:\n   \\[\n   16 - 3 = 13\n   \\]\n3. Janet uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends. So, the number of eggs left after baking muffins is:\n   \\[\n   13 - 4 = 9\n   \\]\n4. Each of the remaining eggs is sold for $2. Therefore, the revenue from selling the eggs is:\n   \\[\n   9 \\times 2 = 18\n   \\]\n\nSo, Janet makes \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.<|im_end|>",

So, the daily cost is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ lollipops/day} \\times 25 \\text{ cents/lollipop} = 100 \\text{ cents/day}\n   \\]\n   Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, this is equivalent to $1 each day.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of lollipops she buys in 5 days:**\n   Over 5 days, she will buy:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ days} \\times 4 \\text{ lollipops/day} = 20 \\text{ lollipops}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find out how many cents she spends on lollipops over 5 days:**\n   The total cost of the lollipops over 5 days is:\n   \\[\n   20 \\text{ lollipops} \\times 100 \\text{ cents/lollipop} = 2000 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n   Converting 2000 cents back to dollars gives:\n   \\[\n   2000 \\text{ cents} = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Convert the spent cents into dollars:**\n   Since she saved all her money except for the change from buying the lollipops, the amount of money she puts in her piggy bank is:\n   \\[\n   25 \\text{ dollars} - 20 \\text{ dollars} = 5 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank after saving for 5 days is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).<|im_end|>",

    "<|im_start|>assistant\nTo determine how much stuffing Mark needs to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds, we start by calculating the amount of stuffing required for each type of bed.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much stuffing is needed for one collie bed. The problem states that a collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed (which takes 8 pounds) and a chihuahua bed (which takes 2 pounds). Therefore, the amount of stuffing for a collie bed is:\n\\[\n\\text{Stuffing per collie bed} = \\frac{8 + 2}{2} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. Since each chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing, the total for 4 chihuahua beds is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 2 = 8 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\nAnd since each collie bed requires 5 pounds of stuffing, the total for 3 collie beds is:\n\\[\n3 \\times 5 = 15 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\nAdding these amounts together gives us the total amount of stuffing needed:\n\\[\n8 + 15 = 23 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\nThus, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{23}\n\\]<|im_end|>",

The number of customers who were kicked out for physical violence is \\( 3(4x - 5) \\).\n\nWe know from the problem statement that the total number of customers who were kicked out is 50.

Therefore, the number of minutes she spends reading each day is:\n\\[\n\\text{Minutes per day} = \\frac{100 \\text{ pages}}{2 \\text{ pages/1.5 minutes}} = \\frac{100}{2} \\times 1.5 = 50 \\times 1.5 = 75 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\nSince this is her daily reading time, we multiply by 7 to get the total reading time for the two weeks:\n\\[\n\\text{Total reading time} = 75 \\text{ minutes/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 525 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, we convert the total reading time from minutes to pages.

Divide her net earnings by the total number of hours worked to get her hourly rate.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of hours Melissa spent on jury duty:**\n   - Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days.\n   - Total hours = \\( 6 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 18 \\text{ hours} \\).\n\n2. **Determine her total earnings from jury duty before expenses:**\n   - Melissa is paid $15 per day.\n   - Total earnings = \\( 15 \\text{ dollars/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 45 \\text{ dollars} \\).\n\n3. **Subtract her daily expenses (parking) from her total earnings to find out her net earnings:**\n   - Daily expense = $3.\n   - Net earnings = \\( 45 \\text{ dollars} - 3 \\text{ dollars} = 42 \\text{ dollars} \\).\n\n4. **Divide her net earnings by the total number of hours worked to get her hourly rate:**\n   - Hourly rate = \\( \\frac{42 \\text{ dollars}}{18 \\text{ hours}} = 2.33 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\).\n\nTherefore, Melissa makes \\(\\boxed{2.33}\\) dollars per hour after expenses.<|im_end|>",

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, he would take half the time, which is \\( \\frac{t}{2} \\) minutes per mile.\n\nVanessa ran 4 miles, so she took \\( 4 \\times t = 4t \\) minutes to complete her part of the race.\n\nAaron ran twice as many miles as Vanessa, so he ran \\( 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\) miles. He completed these at half the speed of Vanessa, taking \\( \\frac{t}{2} \\) minutes per mile. Therefore, Aaron took \\( 8 \\times \\frac{t}{2} = 4t \\) minutes to complete his part of the race.\n\nSince both Aaron and Vanessa completed their parts of the race in the same amount of time, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 4t + 4t = 16 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ 8t = 16 \\]\n\\[ t = 2 \\]\n\nSo, Vanessa took \\( 4t = 4 \\times 2 = 8 \\) minutes to complete her part of the race. Therefore, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).<|im_end|>",

    "<|im_start|>assistant\nTo determine how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the daily revenue from one reservation.\n2. Multiply the daily revenue by the number of days the restaurant is open in a week.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the daily revenue from one reservation:\n- The restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.\n- Each reservation includes 2 meals at $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine.\n- Therefore, the total cost per reservation is \\(2 \\times 5 + 5 = 10\\) dollars.\n\nNext, we calculate the daily revenue for all 6 reservations:\n\\[6 \\text{ reservations} \\times 10 \\text{ dollars/reservation} = 60 \\text{ dollars}\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how much the restaurant makes in a week if it is open 2 days a week:\n\\[60 \\text{ dollars/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days/week} = 120 \\text{ dollars/week}\\]\n\nThus, the amount the restaurant makes in a week is \\(\\boxed{120}\\).<|im_end|>",

    "<|im_start|>assistant\nLet's break down the information given:\n\n1. John had a son named James when he was 19.\n2. James is currently twice as old as his sister Dora.\n3. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.\n\nFirst, let's find out how old Dora is now:\nDora will turn 12 in 3 years, so she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.\n\nNow we know that James is twice as old as Dora, so:\nJames' current age = 2 * Dora's current age = 2 * 9 = 18 years old.\n\nNext, we need to determine how old John's youngest son is now. We know that John was 32 years old when his son was born, and since James is 18 years old now, we can calculate the age difference between them:\nAge difference = John's current age - James' current age = 32 - 18 = 14 years.\n\nSo, John's youngest son is also 14 years old now.\n\nFinally, we want to find out how old John's youngest son will be in 3 years:\nYoungest son's age in 3 years = Youngest son's current age + 3 = 14 + 3 = 17 years old.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(\\boxed{17}\\).<|im_end|>",
    "<|im_start|>assistant\nTo determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after one hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time.\n\nFirst, let's find out how long it takes for both Ana and Jane to peel one orange:\n- Ana peels one orange every 3 minutes.\n- Jane peels one orange every 4 minutes.\n\nNext, we'll calculate how many oranges each can peel in one hour (60 minutes):\n- In 60 minutes, Ana can peel \\( \\frac{60}{3} = 20 \\) oranges.\n- In 60 minutes, Jane can peel \\( \\frac{60}{4} = 15 \\) oranges.\n\nNow, we subtract the number of oranges Jane has peeled from the number of oranges Ana has peeled to find the difference:\n\\[ 20 - 15 = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, after one hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane. The final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]<|im_end|>",

    "<|im_start|>assistant\nLet's denote the number of chickens as \\( c \\) and the number of cows as \\( k \\). We know that each chicken has 1 leg and each cow has 4 legs. Farmer Brown has 20 animals in total, so we can write:\n\n\\[ c + k = 20 \\]\n\nWe also know that the total number of legs is 70, so we can write:\n\n\\[ c + 4k = 70 \\]\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nc + k &= 20 \\\\\nc + 4k &= 70\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTo solve this system, we can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \\( c \\):\n\n\\[\n(c + 4k) - (c + k) = 70 - 20\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n3k = 50\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 3 gives us:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{50}{3} = 16.\\overline{6}\n\\]\n\nSince the number of cows must be a whole number, it seems there might be an error in the problem statement or our interpretation. However, if we assume the problem is correctly stated and proceed with the given numbers, then the number of cows would be approximately 16.67, which doesn't make sense in reality.\n\nGiven the constraints of the problem, let's try solving it again carefully:\n\nFrom the first equation, we get \\( c = 20 - k \\).\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation:\n\n\\[ (20 - k) + 4k = 70 \\]\n\\[ 20 + 3k = 70 \\]\n\\[ 3k = 50 \\]\n\\[ k = \\frac{50}{3} \\approx 16.67 \\]\n\nAgain, since the number of cows must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate the problem statement for any potential errors or misinterpretations. If we assume the problem is correctly stated, then the number of cows would be approximately 16.67, which doesn't make sense in reality.\n\nPlease check the problem statement for any potential errors or misinterpretations.<|im_end|>",
