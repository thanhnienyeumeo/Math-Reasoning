Determine how many eggs Janet eats for breakfast.\n3. Find out how many eggs she has left after eating for breakfast.\n4. Calculate how many eggs she uses to bake muffins for her friends.\n5. Subtract the number of eggs used for baking from the remaining eggs to find out how many eggs she has left at the end of the day.\n6. Convert the number of leftover eggs into dollars.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. The ducks lay 16 eggs per day.\n2. Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Eggs eaten for breakfast} = 3\n   \\]\n3. After breakfast, the number of eggs left is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining eggs after breakfast} = 16 - 3 = 13\n   \\]\n4. Janet uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Eggs used for baking} = 4\n   \\]\n5. After baking, the number of eggs left is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining eggs after baking} = 13 - 4 = 9\n   \\]\n6. Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Money made from selling eggs} = 9 \\times 2 = 18\n   \\]\n\nSo, Janet makes \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.<|im_end|>"]
